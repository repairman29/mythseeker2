# 🏗️ MythSeeker Project Management & Organizational Standards

## 📋 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Repository:** https://github.com/repairman29/mythseeker2  
**Current Status:** Phase 2 Complete (75% refactored)  
**Next Milestone:** Phase 3 - Custom Hooks Implementation  
**Project Health:** 🟢 Excellent (all quality metrics green)

---

## 🎯 **ORGANIZATIONAL PHILOSOPHY**

### **Core Principles**
1. **Quality Over Speed:** No technical debt accumulation
2. **Documentation First:** All decisions and progress documented
3. **Iterative Development:** Small, focused 2-4 hour phases  
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Clear rollback points at each phase
5. **Maintainability:** Code that multiple developers can work on

### **Success Definition**
- **Technical:** Zero TypeScript errors, production-ready code
- **Organizational:** Clear documentation, predictable process
- **Timeline:** Consistent 2-4 hour phase completion
- **Quality:** Code that doesn't require immediate refactoring

## 🔄 **PHASE-BASED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**

### **Phase Structure**
```
Phase Planning (15 min)
├── Define clear deliverables
├── Estimate timeline (2-4 hours)
├── Identify dependencies
└── Set success criteria

Phase Execution (2-4 hours)
├── Focus on single responsibility
├── Regular progress check-ins
├── Document decisions as made
└── Maintain quality gates

Phase Completion (15 min)
├── Run quality checks
├── Document achievements
├── Update project status
└── Plan next phase
```

### **Quality Gates (Required Before Phase Completion)**
```bash
# Technical Validation
npm run type-check     # Must pass with 0 errors
npm run build          # Must build successfully  
npm run lint           # Must pass with 0 warnings

# Project Validation
git status             # All changes committed
git log --oneline -5   # Clean commit history
```

### **Phase Success Criteria**
- [ ] All planned deliverables completed
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] All files under size limits (components <150 lines)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Next phase clearly defined

---

## 📊 **CODE ORGANIZATION STANDARDS**

### **File Size Limits**
```typescript
// Strict size limits to maintain readability
Components: <150 lines     // React components
Services: <200 lines       // Business logic services  
Hooks: <100 lines         // Custom React hooks
Types: <80 lines          // Interface groups
Utils: <60 lines          // Utility functions
```

### **Naming Conventions**
```typescript
// Components (PascalCase)
CharacterCreationModal.tsx
WorldPanel.tsx
DiceRoller.tsx

// Hooks (camelCase with 'use' prefix)
useAuth.ts
useGameState.ts
useDice.ts

// Services (camelCase with 'Service' suffix)
firebaseService.ts
aiService.ts
characterService.ts

// Types (PascalCase interfaces)
interface Character { }
interface Campaign { }
interface GameMessage { }
```

### **Import Organization**
```typescript
// Preferred: Barrel exports for clean imports
import { Button, Modal, Input } from '../components';
import { Character, Campaign } from '../types';
import { FirebaseService, AIService } from '../services';

// Avoid: Deep nested imports
import { Button } from '../components/ui/Button';
import { Character } from '../types/character';
```

## 📋 **TECHNICAL DEBT MANAGEMENT**

### **Priority Classification**
```
🚨 Critical (Fix Immediately)
├── TypeScript errors
├── Build failures  
├── Security vulnerabilities
└── Production blockers

⚠️ High (Next Sprint)
├── Performance issues
├── Missing error handling
├── Testing gaps
└── Memory leaks

📋 Medium (Planned)
├── Code duplication
├── Documentation gaps
├── Refactoring opportunities
└── Architecture improvements

📝 Low (Future)
├── Nice-to-have features
├── Code style improvements
├── Non-critical optimizations
└── UI/UX enhancements
```

### **Debt Prevention Strategies**
- **No "TODO" comments** without GitHub issues
- **No hardcoded values** without constants file
- **No mock data** in production code paths
- **No console.log** statements in committed code
- **No any types** except for true any scenarios

## 🎯 **RISK MANAGEMENT**

### **Common Risk Scenarios & Mitigation**

#### **Scope Creep**
- **Risk:** Adding features during refactoring
- **Mitigation:** Feature freeze policy, clear phase boundaries
- **Early Warning:** Requests for "small additions" or "while we're at it"

#### **Technical Debt Accumulation**  
- **Risk:** Shortcuts to meet timeline pressure
- **Mitigation:** Quality gates, no-compromise policy on TypeScript errors
- **Early Warning:** "We can fix this later" or skipped documentation

#### **Architecture Drift**
- **Risk:** Inconsistent patterns across modules
- **Mitigation:** Regular architecture reviews, clear conventions
- **Early Warning:** Multiple ways to do the same thing

#### **Documentation Lag**
- **Risk:** Code changes without documentation updates
- **Mitigation:** Documentation in same commit as code changes
- **Early Warning:** "Documentation can wait" mindset

### **Contingency Planning**
```
If Phase Exceeds Timeline:
├── Stop and assess scope
├── Identify what can be moved to next phase
├── Complete current work to stable state
└── Document lessons learned

If Quality Gates Fail:
├── Do not proceed to next phase
├── Identify root cause
├── Fix issues before continuing
└── Update process to prevent recurrence

If Dependencies Block Progress:
├── Document the blocker
├── Identify workarounds
├── Switch to unblocked tasks
└── Set clear resolution timeline
```
