## 🚨 **CURRENT BLOCKERS**

### **1. Build Memory Issues** 🔴 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Production build running out of memory  
**Impact:** Can't deploy to production  
**Solution:** Use GitHub Actions for build (more memory available)

### **2. End-to-End Testing** 🟡 LOW
**Issue:** Need to test all features together  
**Impact:** Unknown if everything works together  
**Solution:** Complete integration testing
